# [ESX | QBCore]  Advanced Redeem Code Generator

This is an advanced redeem code generator script. You can create redeem codes for various items, including weapons, vehicles, and money. You can send redeem codes directly to users or create them globally. Vehicles will be stored in the garage of the person who claimed them. If you are using a custom garage, you can modify it via the bridge. The UI is built with React.js, and you can add more items in the config.lua file

# g-redeem-code-generator
This script allows you to create redeem codes for items like weapons, vehicles, and money. You can send codes directly to users or create them globally. Claimed vehicles are stored in the player's garage. The UI is built with React.js, and you can customize items in the config.lua file, making it adaptable to your server's needs.
